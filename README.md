## About Me
ðŸš€ I've been in web development since 2023, and I can code and build web interfaces endlessly. It's not just work â€” it adds flavor to my life.

- ðŸ’» I'm a React developer, passionate about creating dynamic, interactive web applications.
- ðŸŽ¨ In the past, I worked as a web designer, so I handle both the design and development of my projects. Every UI/UX detail is crafted by me to ensure it looks and feels just right.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and responsive web design.
- ðŸŽ¯ My interests include building beautiful user interfaces, optimizing application performance, and refining user experiences.

If you're looking for someone who can bring a design to life with clean code, or want to chat about React, feel free to reach out!
