# Welcome, I'm Varya! 🔥

Hi! I'm Varvara Tikhonova, but feel free to call me Varya. 🙌

## About Me
🚀 I've been in web development since 2023, and I can code and build web interfaces endlessly. It's not just work — it adds flavor to my life.

- 💻 I'm a React developer, passionate about creating dynamic, interactive web applications.
- 🎨 In the past, I worked as a web designer, so I handle both the design and development of my projects. Every UI/UX detail is crafted by me to ensure it looks and feels just right.
- 💬 Ask me about: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and responsive web design.
- 🎯 My interests include building beautiful user interfaces, optimizing application performance, and refining user experiences.

If you're looking for someone who can bring a design to life with clean code, or want to chat about React, feel free to reach out!
